# OnionPress Project Memory

## Meta
- **This file (`CLAUDE.md`) is the project memory.** Store all new memories and notes here so they travel with the repo.

## Upstreaming is in progress (2026-08-16 →)
- **Read `upstream-pr-plan.md` before** touching receiver naming, tor image pins, the
  self-updater URLs, or opening any PR to `brewsterkahle/onionpress`. It records the
  locked decisions (4 stacked PRs, rename-in-fork-first, hardening scope) and holds the
  live status table — keep that table current.
- `upstream/*` branches are frozen cherry-pick branches based on upstream main
  (`94ce1a363`). **Never merge fork main into them**; later fork work is the next wave.

## Open: bootstrap-percentage progress commit needs a joint cherry-pick, not a solo one
- `2c166899` ("report Tor's bootstrap percentage while it bootstraps," on a peer's `feat/wayback-moss-coverage` branch, not yet on `main`) does not cherry-pick cleanly alone — investigated 2026-08-14/15. It conflicts in `app/MacOS/onionpress` around `retag_pinned_images()`, a function that itself doesn't exist yet on `main`: it's introduced by an earlier, also-unmerged commit on the same peer branch. Landing the progress-bar fix requires both commits together (or peer coordination on sequencing), not a standalone pick of `2c166899`. Until this lands, the wait-phase-freeze bug this commit was meant to fix is only partially addressed by tonight's `fix/onionpress-install-progress` work on the moss side.

## Wayback/SPN: two limits measured 2026-08-24 (don't re-derive these)

**1. Save Page Now captures HTML only over .onion — for everyone, and nothing we send changes it.** This was chased for days as a defect of our site. It is not our site. SPN's `resources` array (what it actually fetched) settles it in four submissions: DDG onion plain `success 9.3s resources=0`; clearnet with our speed params `success 10.7s resources=24`; clearnet plain `success 15.7s resources=24`; our onion plain `success 7.4s resources=0`. The middle two are the control on our own `skip_first_archive`/`js_behavior_timeout` params — they do not suppress embeds. The outer two show SPN's Tor path fetching the HTML and stopping, at durations proving it ran out of nothing. Directly submitting an asset URL fails too (`error:no-captures`, our CSS and DDG's alike), so direct and embed capture fail together. **Budget/slow-origin is NOT the mechanism** — we serve 43KB at 2.4–7.5s TTFB against DDG's 172KB at 2.3–4.1s. Intermittent `error:gateway-timeout` on our submissions is transient circuit luck, not a site property. Consequence: the archive holds 138 text/html + 17 rss+xml for our onion and zero of anything else, so replays are whole but unstyled. The Wayback Machine *does* hold other onions' CSS/JS (DDG 82 text/css + 230 JS, IA's own onion 225 JS) arriving in dense same-minute bursts with `warc/revisit` records — a full crawler's signature, not SPN's. Provenance can't be confirmed: CDX redacts the WARC `filename` field and the replay HTML carries no collection marker. Only a different pipeline fixes this; escalate upstream, since OnionPress is IA's own project.

**2. Every SPN call goes to IA's onion mirror, and it fails independently of clearnet.** `onionpress_wayback_user_status()`, `_submit_parallel()` and `_poll_parallel()` all target `web.archivep75mbjunhxc6x4j5mwjmomyxb573v42baldlqu56ruil2oiad.onion`. On 2026-08-24 that host was unreachable (HTTP 000 after 60s) while clearnet `web.archive.org` answered in 5.7s over the *same* SOCKS proxy — so submissions silently returned no job id and `user_status()` returned null, which reads exactly like "SPN is degraded" and is not. **Diagnose the mirror before concluding anything about SPN.** A clearnet fallback would be trivially easy and is deliberately NOT implemented here: both routes go through Tor, but the onion mirror stays inside the network while clearnet exits through an exit node, and that is a privacy call for the project owner, not a bug to patch. Raise it upstream rather than switching it.

## Naming Rules (IMPORTANT)
- The project is called **OnionPress** (one word, capital O and P). Never "Onion.Press", "onion.press", or "onion-press".
- Data directory: `~/.onionpress/` (not `~/.onion.press/`)
- GitHub repo: `brewsterkahle/onionpress`
- Use **"onion service"** (not "hidden service") in all user-facing text. Tor Project deprecated "hidden service" terminology.
  - Exception: file paths like `/var/lib/tor/hidden_service/` and Docker image names like `goldy/tor-hidden-service` cannot change — those are external identifiers.
- When writing new code, docs, issues, or UI text, always use "OnionPress" and "onion service".

## Design Principle: Follow OnionPress's Own Mechanisms
- This is Brewster Kahle's project (Internet Archive). Where it already has a designed mechanism for something — Save Page Now archiving, onion service lifecycle, the moss integration boundary — **extend that mechanism** rather than inventing a parallel one, even when a bespoke fix looks faster.
- When starting new work here, check upstream (`brewsterkahle/onionpress` issues and design notes) for how the original project intended a feature to work before designing from scratch. Reading the intent first is cheaper than discovering it from the code afterwards, and it is what keeps a fork's changes mergeable upstream.
- Examples already in the codebase: the Arti bridge fix (2026-08-09) extended `apply_bridge_config()`'s pattern into a new `apply_arti_bridge_config()` rather than adding a separate bridge-config path for Arti; the watchdog-escalation work extended `tor-watchdog.py`'s existing check/recover loop with more rungs rather than adding a second supervisor process.
- Applies equally to the `moss/plugins/onionpress` integration layer — see ADR-050 there ("moss owns the serving outcome; OnionPress keeps the work") for the cross-repo version of this same rule: moss delegates recovery work to OnionPress's own mechanisms and only acts once those are exhausted, rather than reimplementing them.
- Before finishing any change here, check whether it reached for a new mechanism where one already existed.

## Key Architecture
- macOS menubar app (py2app built from `src/menubar.py`)
- **Quiet launch on the moss-staged copy**: when the bundle lives under `~/.moss/stacks/` (`onionpress.platform.is_quiet_launch`, override `ONIONPRESS_QUIET=1/0`), the MenubarApp shows no launch splash, never auto-opens a browser, ignores the browser-open half of reopen events, and never runs its own setup wizard — moss owns install/start there and the menu bar icon is the only affordance. A standalone `/Applications` install keeps the full startup UX. Wiring is pinned by `tests/test_install_invariants.py::TestMossManagedQuietLaunch`; don't add a new startup window or auto-open path without routing it through `self.quiet_launch`.
- **The launcher has its own half of that gate, and it is the one moss actually calls.** Quiet launch shipped in Python only, so `app/MacOS/onionpress` went on raising an osascript modal ("OnionPress is already starting up") in the middle of a moss install on 2026-08-18 — moss had run that `start` itself, and there was nobody at the keyboard to dismiss it. `is_quiet_launch()` now exists in the shell too, deriving `APP_BUNDLE` from the script's own path and mirroring the Python rule exactly; `tests/test_launcher_quiet_launch.py` asserts every case against *both* implementations so they cannot drift, and the invariant test above fails on any ungated `osascript` in the launcher. **Anything the managed copy needs to say goes to stderr and the log** — moss drains both and narrates them in its advisory UI. Do not add a dialog here on the assumption a human is watching.
- Launcher shell script at `app/MacOS/onionpress` (assembled into `OnionPress.app/Contents/MacOS/` at build time)
- **Anything the launcher backgrounds that is meant to outlive it must be `disown`ed, not just `nohup`ed.** `nohup` makes a child ignore SIGHUP; it does **not** remove the job from the shell's job table, and `start` installs `trap 'rm -f "$PIDFILE"; kill $(jobs -p) …' EXIT INT TERM HUP` after `ensure_menubar_running()` has already backgrounded the MenubarApp. So for two days the `start` that revived the app SIGTERMed it on its way out: a moss install would finish green and ~35s later OnionPress tore the whole stack down, with nothing in any log (the trap is silent) and moss wrongly suspected. It looked intermittent only because a `start` that finds the app alive backgrounds nothing, and a `start` that finds the receiver answering exits *before* the trap is installed — so only a cold start, i.e. the install, could do it. Fixed in `840d204d`; pinned by `tests/test_menubar_revival.py::test_the_app_survives_the_start_arm_finishing`, which extracts the trap from the launcher rather than retyping it. Related trap: `~/onionpress-backups/takeover-check.sh` blamed the OnionHeaven takeover flag for the same deaths — both land where the app's ~90s startup ends, which is also where `start` exits, so the correlation was timing.
- Docker containers (tor, wordpress, mariadb) run inside Colima VM
- Logs at `~/.onionpress/onionpress.log` and `~/.onionpress/launcher.log`
- User-visible content at `~/OnionPress/` (backups, Creations)

## Repo Layout
- `src/menubar.py` — py2app entry point (the only flat module; everything else lives in the package)
- `src/onionpress/` — shared Python package (all non-entry-point code)
- `app/` — macOS .app bundle source (assembled into `OnionPress.app/` at build time)
  - `app/Info.plist` — canonical version source #2
  - `app/MacOS/` — launcher scripts, Swift wrapper source
  - `app/Resources/` — docker configs, plugins, icons, templates
- `OnionPress.app/` — **gitignored build output**, assembled by `build/build-dmg-simple.sh`

## Why py2app
- Modern Macs do NOT ship a usable Python — `/usr/bin/python3` is just a shim that prompts to install Xcode CLI Tools
- Apple removed Python 2 in macOS 12.3 and has no commitment to shipping Python 3 long-term
- py2app bundles the Python interpreter + all dependencies into a self-contained .app so the user never needs to know Python is involved
- This is essential for a consumer app — cannot ask non-technical users to install Xcode Command Line Tools

## Build & Release Process
- MenubarApp built with py2app via `setup.py` (extracted from `build/build-dmg-simple.sh` lines 228-276)
- **After editing ANY `src/` file that the MenubarApp uses, you MUST rebuild the MenubarApp** via `build/rebuild-menubar.sh`. The py2app bundle contains compiled `.pyc` files — editing `src/` alone does NOT update the running app.
- **py2app entry point**: `MenubarApp/Contents/Resources/menubar.py` is the ONLY copy that matters at runtime — py2app `exec()`s it from `__boot__.py`. The copies in `lib/python3.14/` and `scripts/` are unused build artifacts. When hot-patching the installed app without a full rebuild, only update `Contents/Resources/menubar.py` (and its `__pycache__/` pyc).
  - `src/menubar.py` — main app (entry point)
  - `src/onionpress/` — shared package: backup, key_manager, setup_window, onion_proxy, onion_auth, onionheaven, updater, install_native_messaging, native_messaging_host, power, health, docker, tor, colima, platform, config, containers, ui_helpers, settings_ui, browser, log_rotation, analytics_sharing, onionnames_*
  - `setup.py` — py2app config. Adding a new submodule to `onionpress` just means one new line in the `includes` list — no build-script change needed. Build scripts only copy the whole `onionpress` package into site-packages.
- **Release via GitHub releases only** (`gh release create`). Do NOT upload to Internet Archive.
- **Cut releases with `build/release.sh`** — it builds BOTH artifacts and uploads both to one release, so the Linux `.deb` can't be forgotten. (It was: v2.4.101–v2.4.106 shipped only the `.dmg`, which 404'd the README's `releases/latest/download/onionpress.deb` link — that link resolves to the *Latest* release's asset of that name.) Bump + commit first, then run it. Cross-platform rule it enforces: the `.dmg` can only be built on macOS, so on **macOS** it builds `.dmg`+`.deb` and creates/updates the release with both; on **Linux** it builds only the `.deb` and *refuses to create* a release (a `.dmg`-less "Latest" would break the Mac link) — it only attaches the `.deb` to an existing release that already carries the matching `.dmg`. Always run the Mac side first.
- **Version bumping**: run `build/bump-version.sh X.Y.Z` — it updates all version locations automatically. The 2 canonical sources are `src/menubar.py` (`self.version`) and `app/Info.plist` (`CFBundleShortVersionString`). Derived locations (`src/onionpress/__init__.py`, `setup.py` which reads menubar.py dynamically, MenubarApp plist) are updated by the bump script or at build time. The quit log in menubar.py uses `self.version` dynamically. Docker containers get the version via `ONIONPRESS_VERSION` env var from the launcher script (which reads Info.plist).
- **py2app vs setuptools 81+ incompatibility** — setuptools 81 (released 2026-02-06) removed `dry_run` from `distutils.spawn()`, which py2app 0.28.9 still uses. The build script (`build/build-dmg-simple.sh`) handles this automatically: it tries the build first, and falls back to `setuptools<81` only if py2app fails. Once py2app ships a fix, the fallback stops being needed. Track upstream: https://github.com/ronaldoussoren/py2app/issues/557

## Security
- **Database passwords are randomly generated per install** — never use defaults or hardcoded passwords. The `ensure_secrets` function generates unique passwords with `openssl rand` on first run, saved to `~/.onionpress/secrets`.
- Do not commit or log database passwords.

## Colima VM Sandboxing
- The VM has two narrow mounts: `~/.onionpress/shared:w` and `~/OnionPress:w`
- This limits blast radius if a container is compromised — attacker can only see vanity keys and user's published content (which is public anyway)
- `~/.onionpress/` stays as-is for app state (no spaces in path — required by Colima/Lima/Docker socket paths)
- `~/OnionPress/` holds user-visible backups and Creations
- All other container data uses Docker named volumes (which live inside the VM)
- **Do not move app state to `~/Library/Application Support/`** — the space in the path breaks Colima/Docker socket paths (104-char Unix socket limit + space handling issues)
- **Diffdisk cap is 20 GiB on new installs** (issue #230) via `--disk` to the first `colima start` in `app/MacOS/launcher.sh` and `src/onionpress/colima.py`. The cap is set at VM creation and is immutable — existing installs keep their original 100 GiB cap. Dangling Docker images auto-prune after each successful image pull (`update_docker_images()` in `src/menubar.py` and the bash launchers), keeping real usage well under 5 GiB in practice. The cap is configurable via `VM_DISK=N` in `~/.onionpress/config` *before* first launch; when the OnionHeaven hub vanity key is present at first start, the cap auto-bumps to 100 GiB for takeover-container headroom (hub is the edge case; normal nodes never need more than 20).
- **Do not add additional `--mount` flags without considering security implications**

## Multi-User Support (v2.4.11+)
- Multiple macOS users can run OnionPress simultaneously from the same `/Applications/OnionPress.app`
- Each user gets their own `~/.onionpress/` data dir, Colima VM, and Docker containers
- **Port offsets**: second user auto-detects port 8080 is taken and offsets all ports by +10000 (18080/19050/19077), third user by +20000, etc. Max ~5 users.
- **Detection uses socket bind test**, not `lsof` — `lsof` only sees the current user's processes and cannot detect ports bound by other users
- **Port detection must happen in the MenubarApp's `__init__`** (Python socket bind), not in the shell scripts — the MenubarApp launches first and needs the correct ports before the `onionpress` script runs
- **Module-level constants in `onionpress.onion_proxy`** (`PROXY_PORT`, `PHP_PROXY_PORT`) are set at import time. The MenubarApp must update these globals after detecting the offset: `onion_proxy.PROXY_PORT = self.proxy_port`
- The `onionpress` shell script also has detection as a fallback (for standalone use), but respects pre-set `ONIONPRESS_PORT_OFFSET` env var from the MenubarApp
- **`LSMultipleInstancesProhibited` must NOT be in any Info.plist** — macOS enforces it across ALL users sharing the same app bundle, not just per-user
- **`pgrep` in the launcher must use `-u $(whoami)`** to restrict to the current user's processes
- **PID lock file** (`~/.onionpress/onionpress.pid`) prevents the same user from double-launching; cleaned up via `trap` on EXIT/INT/TERM/HUP
- **Container-internal ports are NOT offset** — Docker networking (`onionpress-tor:9050`, `wordpress:80`) is isolated per-VM. Only host-side port mappings change.
- `OnionPress.app/` is gitignored — it is assembled at build time from `app/` source. Never commit build output.

## Colima Networking Gotcha
- **SOCKS proxy (port 9050) does NOT work through Colima VM port forwarding** — connections are accepted then immediately closed
- **For ANY communication over Tor from the Mac, always use `docker exec` into the tor container** — this is reliable
  - Do NOT use `curl --socks5-hostname 127.0.0.1:9050` from the Mac host — it will fail
- This applies to future mirror system communication (health checks, challenge-response, etc.)
- **`wget` inside the tor container CANNOT fetch external .onion addresses** — it doesn't support SOCKS proxies, so it can't resolve .onion via Arti. `wget` only works for internal container-to-container requests (e.g., `wget http://wordpress:80/`).
- **To fetch external .onion addresses, use `socat` with SOCKS4A** inside the tor container:
  - `printf "GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: <address>.onion\r\nConnection: close\r\n\r\n" | socat -t 10 - SOCKS4A:127.0.0.1:<address>.onion:80,socksport=9050`
  - Or install `curl` in the tor container and use `curl --socks5-hostname 127.0.0.1:9050`
- WordPress container has `curl`
- Test onion service path (internal): `docker exec onionpress-tor wget -q -O /dev/null http://wordpress:80/`
