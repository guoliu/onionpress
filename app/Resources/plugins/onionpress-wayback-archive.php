 * Plugin Name: OnionPress Wayback Archive
 * Description: Archives the site's posts, home page, and RSS feed to the
 *              Internet Archive's Wayback Machine via Save Page Now (SPN2).
 *              When a moss-generated static site is serving, its own pages
 *              (which are files, not WordPress posts) and its own feed join
 *              the same queue in place of the WP boilerplate posts — see
 *              "the static site's own pages" below.
 *              Fire-and-forget pipeline: a 60s cron tick polls outstanding
 *              job_ids in batch, then submits fresh work up to the account's
 *              current available-slots count. No per-URL retry counter,
 *              no back-off chain — a failed submit is simply retried on a
 *              later tick. Two global gates throttle the whole sweep:
 *              (1) self-reachability of our onion, (2) SPN account slots.

// worst case was unbounded: submit_parallel alone can run 8 sequential
// chunks at a 40s timeout.
//
// What the budget actually protects is the lock. The loop heartbeats
// op_wayback_sweep_lock around each iteration, so an iteration that
// outruns OP_WB_LOOP_LOCK_STALE_SEC lets a second daemon declare the lock
// dead and start up alongside this one, both writing the same records.
//
// The bound has to be stated as budget PLUS overshoot, because every gate
// is checked on phase entry and the phase it admits then runs to its own
// timeout. Each phase re-checks, so at most one can overshoot:
//   poll    entering at the line: 1 group             = +40s
//   CDX     entering at the line: 1 group             = +25s
//   submit  entering at the line: 20s probe + 1 group = +60s  <- worst

//
// That is not merely untidy. WordPress caches options and post queries
// per REQUEST, and this daemon is a single request; a process that never

    // run "after page load", and force_get=1 is the separate option that
    // would bypass the headless browser. We must NOT set force_get here —
    // that one really would reduce every capture to a bare HTML GET.
    //
    // So when a capture of ours replays without its images, the cause is
    // not on this line — and it is not our origin being slow either. That
    // "a slow onion spends SPN's 50s budget on the HTML and the embeds
    // fall off" account stood in this comment for a while and it is
    // WRONG. Measured 2026-08-24 with four submissions:
    //
    //     ddg onion,  plain (no params)      success  9.3s   resources=0
    //     clearnet,   WITH these speed params success 10.7s  resources=24
    //     clearnet,   plain (control)         success 15.7s  resources=24
    //     our onion,  plain (no params)       success  7.4s  resources=0
    //
    // Read the middle two rows first: they are the control on this very
    // line. skip_first_archive/js_behavior_timeout do NOT suppress embed
    // capture — clearnet pulls 24 subresources with them set, the same 24
    // it pulls without. The paragraph above about force_get is correct.
    //
    // Then read the outer two: over .onion SPN reports **zero** resources,
    // for DuckDuckGo exactly as for us, at a duration that shows it did
    // not run out of anything. Budget is not the mechanism. SPN's Tor path
    // simply fetches the HTML and stops; its clearnet path runs the
    // headless browser and follows embeds. Nothing we send, and nothing
    // about our server, moves that.
    //
    // (Our origin is also not slow: 2.4-7.5s TTFB over Tor against DDG's
    // 2.3-4.1s, serving 43KB against their 172KB. The intermittent
    // error:gateway-timeout on our submissions is transient circuit luck,
    // not a property of this site — the same URL succeeded in 7.4s.)
    //
    // What we do instead is refuse to call such a capture complete: see
    // onionpress_wayback_resources_state() and the bare-captures counter.
    //
    // Do NOT "fix" this by submitting the assets as their own URLs. That
    // was measured on 2026-08-24 and it does not work over .onion — for
    // anyone, not just us. Submitting four URLs in one window gave:
    //
    //     our  HTML  -> error:gateway-timeout
    //     our  CSS   -> error:no-captures ("unreachable")
    //     DDG  HTML  -> SUCCESS in 20s (ts 20260824095713)
    //     DDG  CSS   -> error:no-captures ("unreachable")
    //
    // DuckDuckGo's onion is fast, healthy, and its HTML captured on the
    // spot in that same window, so this is not Tor congestion and not a
    // slow origin — and it is not something about our server, which was
    // the standing suspicion. A directly-submitted non-HTML URL over
    // .onion fails, full stop. It is not the file either: 29-byte
    // byte-identical files on our own onion capture as .html and fail as
    // .css, so the discriminator is the extension/Content-Type, not size
    // or reachability.
    //
    // The Wayback Machine does hold onion CSS/JS — DDG's onion has 82
    // text/css and 230 x-javascript records, IA's own onion 225 JS, dated
    // 202602-202606. Those did not come through Save Page Now; CDX
    // redacts the WARC `filename` field, so the pipeline can't be read
    // off the index, but whatever captured them is not the API we have.
    // Treat bare captures over onion as SPN's steady state, not as a
    // defect of this site to be chased.
    //
    // (An earlier version of this comment said it was "not established"
    // whether page-embed capture fails for the same reason. It is now:
    // resources=0 over onion vs 24 over clearnet, above. Direct submission
    // and embed capture fail together, and they fail for everyone.)
    //
    // Net effect on this site: over .onion the Wayback Machine can only
    // ever hold our HTML. Confirmed against the index — 138 text/html and
    // 17 rss+xml records for our onion, and zero of anything else. Pages
    // replay whole (see the no-gzip work in multisite.py) but unstyled,
    // because the stylesheet they reference was never captured. No
    // parameter, retry, or resubmission strategy on our side changes
    // that; only a different capture pipeline would. Belongs in the
    // report to IA — and OnionPress is IA's own project, so that report
    // has somewhere to go.
    //
    // Dropped `if_not_archived_within=1h` — on retries after a failed
    // onion crawl, SPN was returning the cached error instead of re-
    // trying with a fresh circuit. Relying on SPN's built-in default
    // lets genuinely failed URLs retry sooner on new circuits.
    //
    // That default is NOT the 45 minutes this comment used to assert. A
    // resubmission 75 minutes later came back with the *identical* job
    // id, so the real dedup window is >=75 min. Anything that reasons
    // about "it will retry in 45 minutes" is wrong.

// Investigated 2026-08-24: submitting each image/CSS/JS URL to SPN as
// its own job did not work that day, so no per-asset submission path
// ships here — but read the whole note before treating that as settled.
//
// The controlled experiment (same window, minutes apart, our Tor client
// verified healthy by a third-party onion fetch first):
//   - our onion's HOME PAGE as an SPN job  -> status:success in 10.3s,
//     http_status:200, and counters.embeds=0 / resources=[]. SPN's
//     crawler reaches this onion and captures HTML; it fetched no
//     embedded resources even from a successful page capture.
//   - our onion's CSS FILE as its own job, submitted in BOTH the
//     http:// and https:// URL forms -> error:no-captures for each,
//     "...unreachable" — which the successful page capture in the same
//     minutes proves is factually wrong as a reachability claim.
//   - earlier the same day: a favicon and a PNG on DuckDuckGo's onion
//     (fast, well-provisioned, unrelated to us), with force_get=1 and
//     without -> error:no-captures as well.
// So on 2026-08-24, SPN captured onion HTML pages while failing every
// standalone non-HTML onion URL, across two sites and both URL schemes.
//
// What this does NOT establish — and this file previously overclaimed
// it, in exactly the way that was already made and retracted on
// 2026-08-13 ("archive.org's onion is unreachable" -> our own Tor was
// degraded; "no onion captures since June, SPN regressed" -> nobody had
// submitted any; one live submission then succeeded in 6.6s):
//   - "cannot, for anyone, permanently". SPN's /save/status flips
//     success -> error:no-captures for a job whose capture actually
//     landed (that is why the CDX-rescue path in this file exists), IA
//     serves "Temporarily Offline" pages mid-outage, and CDX absence
//     only ever proves absence of submissions. A failure report from
//     any of these channels is weather until CDX, checked later, says
//     otherwise.
// Before acting on this note in either direction, re-run the experiment
// above — page control first, then assets, then CDX a while later. Do
// not write "SPN cannot" anywhere (comments, commits, issues) from
// error responses alone.
//
// Until a re-run shows asset jobs landing: resources_state below is the
// remedy we can ship — stop calling embed-less captures successful.

        <h2>How it works</h2>
        <p>A background daemon runs continuously, batching up to 40 post URLs per iteration
            through Save Page Now. Each submission returns a <code>job_id</code>;
            a subsequent poll tells us <code>success</code> (capture made),
            <code>pending</code> (SPN still crawling) or <code>error</code> (SPN crawler
            couldn't reach the URL).</p>
        <p>On <code>error:no-captures</code> the daemon falls back to CDX (Wayback's own
            index): if Wayback already has the URL captured (possibly from a prior attempt),
            the post is marked archived without resubmission. Otherwise the post is requeued
            for the next pass.</p>
        <p>Outgoing SPN traffic is routed through a separate Tor instance
            (<code>onionheaven</code>) so that heavy archival bursts don't starve the Tor
            daemon serving your onion. The <strong>heartbeat</strong> to OnionHeaven keeps your
            address registered as <em>online</em>; if heartbeats lapse for too long,
            OnionHeaven activates a <strong>takeover redirector</strong> at your address — so
            visitors get a polite "this site is offline, try again later" page instead of a
            timeout. The moment your heartbeat resumes, the takeover lifts and your real
            WordPress serves again.</p>
        <p>If the daemon dies (crash, reboot, Mac sleep), the mutex lock goes stale after
            5 minutes and the next WordPress page view causes wp-cron to restart the daemon
            from the persisted cursor. No progress is lost; no duplicates are created.</p>
