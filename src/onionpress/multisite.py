"""WordPress multisite + theme/plugin post-install steps.

Ported from the duplicated bash implementations in app/MacOS/onionpress
and linux/onionpress. The `provision-post-install` subcommand on both
platforms now delegates to this module so the two stay in sync
automatically.

Step order matters — see `provision_post_install` for the rationale.
Each individual step is also exposed as a top-level function so callers
that already have part of the state (e.g. `start_containers` after a
restore) can invoke just the steps they need.

# Work around a Wayback replay bug: send pages uncompressed.
#
# This is a workaround for a defect on the archive's side, not good practice
# in itself. Serving gzip is correct and near-universal, and the day the bug
# is fixed this block should come back out. Keep it framed that way -- the
# temptation when captures look wrong is to start deforming the site (inline
# the CSS, drop external assets), and that trades a real site for a slightly
# better archived one.
#
# Every replay of this site came back truncated -- to roughly a sixth of the
# page, cut off mid-tag with no closing </html>. The replayed byte count was
# not merely close to the gzipped size, it equalled it exactly, on every page
# measured (2026-08-24: home 7487/43658, /illuminated-books/ 6628/34734,
# /blogroll/ 20318/55856, /follow/ 24342/111821 -- replayed/identity, with
# gzipped == replayed in all four). Replay serves the *decompressed* body
# while still advertising the origin's *compressed* Content-Length, and cuts
# to it. The stored record itself looks intact: its CDX length, ~7908 for the
# home page, is the whole 7487-byte gzipped body plus headers.
#
# What this is NOT is a general "Wayback cannot do gzip" claim -- that was
# the first read here and it is wrong. www.debian.org serves exactly the same
# combination, gzip with an explicit Content-Length, and replays whole (18713
# bytes, closing </html>, six stylesheet links intact). Most of the web is
# fine. Something narrower is at work, and from outside the archive there is
# no way to tell what; the onion capture path is the obvious suspect and the
# only real fix is IA's. See also the `wayback` Python client, which carries
# its own workaround for Wayback mangling Content-Encoding on mementos.
#
# The damage runs past the missing bytes. A page cut off before most of its
# markup replays with almost nothing in it, so the stylesheet never loads and
# moss's inline low-res placeholders render at their full width/height
# attributes as giant blurred boxes.
#
# Proven by controlled experiment, not inference: with `SetEnv no-gzip 1` on
# a single path, /writings/the-mental-traveller/ replayed at 13537 bytes --
# its exact identity length, closing </html> -- while the rest of the site,
# still gzipped, went on truncating. Reverted immediately after. The sitewide
# form then took the home page from 7487 bytes and 2 of 19 images to 55355
# bytes with all 19.
#
# Confirmed end-to-end in the archive, not just on the wire, on 2026-08-24:
# a post-fix capture (ts 20260824101350) replays at 43658 bytes -- byte-for-
# byte what the server sends -- with all 19 <img>, the stylesheet <link>, and
# a closing </html>. Pre-fix captures of the same page (e.g. ts 20260824072704)
# still replay truncated at 7487 with 2 of 19, so old records do NOT heal; the
# page has to be re-captured after the fix to benefit.
#
# Two traps when checking this. (1) CDX `length` is the COMPRESSED WARC record
# size, not the page size -- the good 43658-byte capture indexes as length 7891,
# which looks identical to the broken 7487-byte era and is not. Replay it before
# concluding anything. (2) CDX `statuscode` reads 204 on these records while the
# replay serves a full 200 body, so a 204 there is not an empty capture either.
# Both misled a session into reporting a regression that had not happened.
#
# So pages go out uncompressed and static assets keep their gzip. The cost
# is small and lands where there is room for it: a page is a few tens of KB
# next to the hundreds of KB of imagery beside it, while CSS and JS -- the
# files that compress best and are fetched on every page -- are untouched.
# The pattern names the documents positively: a directory URL, an .html
# file, the feed, a WordPress page routed through index.php.
#
# Listing the documents rather than excluding the assets is not a style
# choice. SetEnvIf has no regex negation: its "!" attaches to the variable
# being unset, never to the pattern, so a rule written "!\\.(css|js)$" is a
# regex hunting for a literal "!" and quietly never fires. That exact form
# was tried here first and shipped an inert rule -- the config parsed, the
# server stayed up, the pages went on being gzipped and truncated.
#
# The feed is in the list on purpose. It is not an asset the archive picks
# up in passing: the sweep submits /rss.xml by name, and 17 copies of it
# are already stored, every one cut to its gzipped length like the pages.
#
# Leaving the assets gzipped costs nothing today, because none of them reach
# the archive at all. Same onion, same window, two 29-byte files with
# identical bytes: the one served as text/html captured, the one served as
# text/css came back "unreachable". Non-HTML over the onion is a second,
# separate defect, and no server-side setting here reaches it.

    Same reasoning as install_static_site_conf: docker-compose.yml pulls the
    WordPress image by digest from a registry the fork does not own, so a
    `COPY` in our Dockerfile only reaches a container someone else built.
    Runtime injection reuses the published image unchanged.

    Why an overlay under a different name rather than overwriting: unlike
    onionpress-static-site.conf, the image ALREADY ships
    /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/onionpress-uploads.ini — present, but without
    the memory_limit a static-generation upload needs. PHP reads conf.d in
    alphabetical order, last value wins, so copying our version to
    zz-onionpress-uploads.ini overrides the image's without touching it. The
    image's file stays pristine (an upstream revision of it is not silently
    clobbered), and backing the injection out is a plain `rm` of a file we
    alone own.

    The reload is not optional. mod_php reads conf.d when an Apache worker
    initialises, so `docker cp` alone leaves every live worker on the old
    limit — verified against a real container: the copy lands, the served
    value stays 128M, and only `apache2ctl graceful` moves it to 512M.

    `conf_dir` is the on-disk directory holding onionpress-uploads.ini — the

    Why this is separate from install_static_site_conf: /etc/apache2 is
    container rootfs, not a Docker volume, so the conf is destroyed by any

    plain restart keeps it. provision_post_install normally re-injects it
    on the next start, but the launcher's `start` exits early when a
    publish receiver is already answering ("stack is already running,
    nothing to do") and so never reaches that provisioning.

    A recreate done behind the launcher's back therefore leaves the conf
    missing indefinitely, and the failure is silent in the worst way:
    publishes keep succeeding, the receiver keeps reporting the correct
    current generation, and the onion just serves the WordPress theme
    instead of the published site.

    Cheap by design — one `test -e` in the container on the happy path,

    a docker cp plus an Apache reload, and an app update recreates the
    container anyway (dropping the conf entirely), so provision_post_install
    installs the new version on the very next start.

    Only the macOS launcher needs this. The Linux launcher's `start` has no
