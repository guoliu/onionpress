"""Integration tests for the Wayback archive plugin's sweep engine.

These drive the live plugin inside the onionpress-wordpress container
via `wp eval`, using the mock filter hooks we added to short-circuit
every network-touching function (user_status, submit, poll, cdx,
self_reachable) — no real Tor/SPN traffic.

Coverage focus: behaviors that are easy to break during refactors.
  1. Queue totals aggregate across every subsite in the network.
  2. Young-job skip: a job submitted in the last 15s must NOT be
     polled (wastes a Tor round-trip on a guaranteed "pending").
  3. Submit path: a fresh post with no job_id gets one, with a
     matching submitted_at, on a successful submit.
  4. Lock mutex: a fresh lock blocks a second sweep invocation.

The rest guard the ways this engine has actually wedged in production,
all of which shared one shape — it kept logging a healthy sweep while
archiving nothing:
  5. A job SPN has FORGOTTEN (absent from /save/status, not "pending"
     or "error") must be cleared, or that URL deadlocks permanently.
  6. A job whose status batch never came back must NOT be cleared —
     failing to ask is not the same as being told it is gone.
  7. CDX rescue + the $answered guard, in one iteration: an SPN "error"
     must be verified against CDX before being written off, and must
     not be swept up as forgotten on the way there.
  8. Coverage bookkeeping in poll_parallel itself, driven through the
     curl seam rather than mocked past: only a batch that came back as
     a JSON list of statuses counts as an answer about its job_ids.
  9. The daemon must recycle on a timer and hand its lock back. It ran
     70 hours in one PHP request, serving option reads from a cache
     that predated the fix being applied to the database.
 10. The published static site's own pages are in the queue. They are
     files, not posts, so get_posts() cannot see them — a site whose
     real content was 32 static pages reported "6/6 archived, 100%"
     while archiving six leftover WordPress defaults.

Prerequisites (skips the suite if any fails):
  - Docker running
  - `onionpress-wordpress` container up with the wayback plugin
    present in mu-plugins/
  - At least one subsite to target

Set ONIONPRESS_WP_CONTAINER to run against a scratch WordPress instead of
the developer's live one. These tests write real options and post meta, and
the mocks only stop the *network* calls — pointing them at a throwaway
container is the way to run them without touching a site somebody is serving.
